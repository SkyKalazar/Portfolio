The project is a climbing journal. Each user can create their own "individual space" and perform CRUD operations on their entries. The entries are meant to track user's climbing routes, their insights and technical information. The user can filter through their entries to find their current project (based on date, location, companions, difficulty and technical requirements).
For the development Angular with Typescript is used (on WebStorm).

Currently the project has a fully formed Product Backlog. In terms of development, it just scratched the surface.
