A repository that contains the projects that I had worked on in the past year and a half.

Has two sections:
1. Semester projects - developed every semester, uniting all the disciplines that are being taught during that semester. It is a group work, therefore it involves a fair amount of communication, team work and cohesion. Developed in a team of 4 people.
2. Personal project - my own initiative to try to develop something extracurricular. In the current state it is a climbing journal idea with a completed product backlog.
